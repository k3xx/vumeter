This program reads peak audio samples from a PulseAudio sink and sends
them to a digital-to-analog converter (which is intended to be
connected to an analog VU meter). It runs on a Raspberry Pi but will
probably work on other platforms by adjusting the DAC class.

Originally from https://bitbucket.org/mjs0/raspberry_pi-vu_meter/
Extented to the PCF8591 DAC.
